# flask_api_sample
simple example of using flask to generate an api

## Setup

This project has a Vagrant-backed platform and standard setup. The Vagrant box is Ubuntu 14.04 and is provided by Hashicorp. Running `vagrant up` will stand up the VM and provision it with the dependencies required to run this application. The operator will need to `vagrant ssh` into the VM and start the services as described below in the section "How to Use".

**This configuration has been tested successfully with Vagrant 1.8.1. Vagrant 1.7.3 will _not_ work with the specified `chef-zero` provisioner.**

Alternatively, the following Python modules may be installed by hand directly on your computer to meet the application's requirements for a local (bare metal) run.

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
:   `pip install Flask`

[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
:   `pip install requests`

[flask-httpauth](https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
:   `pip install flask-httpauth`

[passlib](https://pythonhosted.org/passlib/)
:   `pip install passlib`

## How to Use

From a command line at the root of the project, run

	python flask_api.py

A list of `curl` commands to test the REST API is included in `curl_commands.txt`.

To test the api service using the Front End flask app, open another terminal window and run 

	python front_end.py

This sample uses a simple list of objects as our data store. The principles can be easily transferred to using a backend of your choice.

On the browser go to either `http://localhost:5001` (if running locally) or `http://localhost:8000` (if running in the VM) to view the front end portion.

You can run tests from the command line by running 

	python api_tests.py

## Future Work

This demo/example would work great with a simple mongo backend and ORM implementation in the code.

Also, it would be nice to set up a [Vagrant]('https://www.vagrantup.com/') script for launching a VM with all the dependencies pre-installed so users could see it working without installing and configuring dependencies themselves.
